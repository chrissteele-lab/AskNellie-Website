# Google Business Profile Setup Guide

Yes, the approach you described is completely doable! You can set up the profile under your own Google account to draft all the content, and then invite your client as an admin (Owner or Manager) later. Once they have access, they can complete the verification process to make the profile "go live."

Here is the step-by-step process:

## Phase 1: Initial Setup ("Draft Mode")

In this phase, you will create the profile and fill in all the details. We hold off on the verification step so that the profile isn't fully published and visible to the public yet.

1.  **Sign in to Google:** Go to [Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/business/) and sign in with *your* Google account.
2.  **Add your business:** Click "Manage now" or "Add a business". Enter the business name: **Ask Nellie Handyman Services**
3.  **Choose the business type:** Select **Service-area business** (since Neil visits customers and doesn't have a typical storefront for walk-ins).
4.  **Enter the Business Category:** Pick **Handyman** as the primary category. (You can add secondary categories like Kitchen Remodeler, Plumber, or Carpenter later).
5.  **Add the Location / Service Areas:**
    *   Choose *not* to show a physical address (unless he operates out of a specific shop customers visit).
    *   Instead, specify the service areas. Add: **Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Leek, Stone, Stafford, Cheadle, Biddulph, Kidsgrove, Audley, Endon, Brown Edge, Werrington, Trentham**. (You can also add the specific six towns: Hanley, Stoke, Fenton, Longton, Burslem, Tunstall).
6.  **Add Contact Details:**
    *   **Phone number:** 07527 282354
    *   **Website URL:** https://www.asknellie.co.uk (or the exact domain you are using)
7.  **Hold off on Verification (The "Draft" Step):**
    *   Google will ask you to verify the business (via phone, text, video, or postcard).
    *   **Crucial Step:** Instead of verifying right now, look for an option that says **"Verify Later"** or **"Skip"** at the bottom of the screen. 
    *   By skipping verification, the profile remains in a pending/draft state. Only you (and anyone you invite) can see it in your dashboard, but it won't appear on Google Maps yet.
    *   *Alternative:* You can also set the "Opening Date" in the profile settings to a future date to indicate the business isn't ready for public traffic yet.
8.  **Flesh out the Profile:** Even while unverified, you can add business hours, a description, services/products, and photos (like the logo and header images we've created). You and the client can review this before the public sees it.

## Phase 2: Transferring Access to the Client

Once the profile looks good and you are ready to hand it over:

1.  Go to your Google Business Profile dashboard (search for "my business" on Google while logged into your account, or go to google.com/business).
2.  Click the three-dot menu icon (⋮) next to the business name, or look for **Business Profile settings**.
3.  Click **Managers** (or "People and access").
4.  Click **Add** and enter the client's email address. *(Note: They must have a Google account or a Google Workspace email to accept).*
5.  Select their Role:
    *   **Owner:** Best option for handoff. They will have full administrative control, which they'll need to run the business profile long-term.
    *   **Manager:** Can edit the profile but has fewer administrative rights.
6.  Click **Invite**. The client will receive an email invitation to accept access to the profile.

## Phase 3: Going Live (Client Verification)

To make the profile actively show up on Google Maps and search results, it must be verified. Since Google often requires localized proof, the client is usually best positioned to do this.

1.  Once the client accepts the invitation, direct them to log into their [Google Business Profile dashboard](https://www.google.com/business/).
2.  They should see a prominent banner or button that says **"Get Verified"**.
3.  They will need to follow the prompts. The verification methods Google offers depend on the business type and region, but may include:
    *   **Video Recording:** Walking around the premises, unlocking the front door, showing equipment/branded vehicles.
    *   **Live Video Call:** With a Google support representative.
    *   **Postcard:** Google mails a physical postcard with a PIN to the business address (usually takes 5-14 days).
    *   **Phone/Text:** Sometimes available for established business phone numbers.
    *   **Email:** Sometimes available if the domain email matches the website.
4.  Once the client completes the verification step and Google approves it, the profile will be **Live on Google Maps!**
5.  *(Optional)* Once the client is an "Owner" and the profile is verified, the client can remove you from the managers list, or you can remove yourself if you no longer need access.
