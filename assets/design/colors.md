Here is the text breakdown of the suggested color palette for your website:

Action Orange (#E85D04): Use this vibrant color for your Primary Call-to-Action buttons (like "Get a Quote") and important highlights to draw the eye.

Trust Blue (#3A6FA5): A strong, reliable color perfect for your main headings and structural brand elements (like navigation bars or borders).

Calm Wash (#BBDDED): A light, airy blue that works beautifully as a background color for content sections to break up plain white pages.

Tool-Belt Tan (#A67C52): A warm, earthy tone that ties in with the handyman theme. Great for secondary buttons, footers, or accent icons.

Text Charcoal (#333333): A dark grey that is much easier on the eyes than pure black, ideal for all your main body copy and standard icons.
